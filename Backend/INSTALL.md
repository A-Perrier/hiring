# Thanks for reviewing my test :)

Please run the following to setup the project : 

- `cd PHP/Boilerplate && composer install`
- Change your local DB access in the `.env` file
- `php ./fleet create-users`

This light setup allow in the first reading of `./fleet` to generate the tables into the Database.

Then, you'll create a set of 10 users to begin your tests. This was not a bullet point of the test, but I thought it would be
better for you rather than create your users manually.
