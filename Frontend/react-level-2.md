## [front/react] Github user search

## Instructions

Create a search input text where users can type in and get results straight away, without ENTER keypress or submit button required.
Results will list Github users as a list. It is up to you to define which data about Github users is relevant to display.

### The subject

1. Query against Github Api: GET https://api.github.com/search/users?q={USER}.
2. Try to not add any dependency library on a freshly created
   [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
3. Don't forget to check against modern ways to make HTTP requests on frontend side.
4. Bonus: manage edge cases (no results, Github api rate limit, user type in quickly and going back and forth on his search)

### Guidelines

- Use React.js to render the view
- Push your code to a Github repository
- Document what you've done

### Evaluation

- Quality of the code
- Scalability of the algorithm
- Usage of good practices and modern javascript
- Bonus: explicite UI and appealing look and feel
